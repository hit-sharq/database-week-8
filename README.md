# Project Title
Library Management System Database

## Description
This project implements a complete relational database management system for a Library Management use case using MySQL. It includes tables for Authors, Books, Members, Loans, and Genres with proper constraints and relationships.

## How to run/setup the project
1. Import the `library_management.sql` file into your MySQL server.
2. Use a MySQL client or command line to execute the SQL script:
   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < library_management.sql
   ```
3. The script will create all necessary tables with constraints and relationships.

## ERD
A conceptual Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for this database can be created using tools like MySQL Workbench or draw.io. It includes entities such as Authors, Books, Members, Loans, and Genres with their relationships.

You can create the ERD based on the schema defined in `library_management.sql`.

Question 1: Build a Complete Database Management System
Objective:
Design and implement a full-featured database using only MySQL.

What to do:

Choose a real-world use case (e.g., Library Management, Student Records, Clinic Booking System, Inventory Tracking, etc.)

Create a well-structured relational database using SQL.

Use SQL to create:

Tables with proper constraints (PK, FK, NOT NULL, UNIQUE)

Relationships (1-1, 1-M, M-M where needed)

Deliverables:

A single .sql file containing your:

CREATE TABLE statements

Submission Instructions
